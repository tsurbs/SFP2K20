# SFP2K20

This is the code from my 2020 Science Fair Project, "Modeling Crowd Dynamics to Improve School Design Safety"
 
A key component was intended to be a simulation which I would have users participate in where they would use their arrow keys to navigate a school map, however due to complications from the onset of COVID-19 I moved to a modeling approach to reduce the need for human input.  However, the simulation still exists and functions.  

It was formerly hosted on heroku so that multiple users could be using it at the same time, but heroku has since removed its free tier, but it can still be run locally.

The code for the simulation server is in the root folder’s app.js file, and the code served to the clients is in the index.html file.  The Model code and data can be found in the folder entitled “Model”

This is a slideshow with some background into the project as a whole:
